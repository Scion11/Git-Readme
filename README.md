<h3>Hi everyone this is my first time for making readme file on reposity.</h3>

<h4>I want to teach you how to connect your repositry from github to your local storage.</h4>

<h4>These are the steps.</h4>

<p>First you need to clone your repository to you local storage by copying the url code to your repository</p>
